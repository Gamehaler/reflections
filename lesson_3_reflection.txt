1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever I'm working with more people or when I intend to work from more 
    than one place.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because something could be delited on server or I could make change that 
    is not on server yet.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is online copy of a repository, clone is local / online copy and 
    branch is local copy.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can keep track of someone elses work that way.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be harder to work on the same file because it couldn't be posible 
    for more than 1 person to work on that file at once.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If there is more people working on the same files it would be good to 
    make a new branch for every one of them.
