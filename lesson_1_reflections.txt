How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me isolate the changed parts so I didn't have to check all of the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would help me find old versions of code that could help me fix the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that commits can be logically separated and pros are that 
    programmer can forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is ment for version control of the code and code can relate to another 
    code in some other file, Google Docs is ment for storing and version 
    control of the files that are not related one to another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log allows us to see all commints of a file and with git diff we 
    can check what's the change between 2 updates.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control gives me a chance to reverse the change in the code so 
    I can go back if something is not working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to upload a version of a file.
